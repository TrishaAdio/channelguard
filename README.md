# Channel Guard (Telethon userbot)

Locks down a channel's access:

1. Every **`ROTATE_MINUTES`** (default 5) it **revokes** the channel's invite
   link, issues a **fresh** one, and **DMs it to the owner**.
2. Anyone who **joins** the channel is **kicked immediately** (the owner and
   admins are exempt).

So a leaked link dies within minutes, and nobody who slips in stays.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py
```

`setup.py` logs in your account (phone -> OTP -> 2FA), lets you **pick the
channel from a list**, asks for the **owner** (username or id) who receives the
links, and writes `.env`.

> The logged-in account must be an **admin** of the channel with **"Invite
> users via link"** and **"Ban users"** rights.

## Run

```bash
python guard.py
```

Leave it running. The owner starts getting a fresh invite link every few
minutes, and joiners get removed.

## Quick-reply userbot (`quickreply.py`) — optional second account

Keeps your **Business quick reply** (default `/demo`) pointing at the **latest
invite link**. It swaps **only the link** inside your post and leaves everything
else exactly as-is — your text, markdown formatting, and premium (custom) emoji
are preserved (entity offsets are re-aligned automatically). Set up your
`/demo` post once (link + whatever text/emoji you want); the bot only rewrites
the link part on each rotation.

How it fits together:

```
guard.py  (account A)  --DMs the link-->  owner (account B)
quickreply.py (account B, the owner)  --sees the link-->  updates /demo
```

- Run `quickreply.py` on the **owner** account (the one that receives the
  guard's DMs and holds the quick reply). It's a **separate login** (its own
  `quickreply.session`), same `API_ID`/`API_HASH`.
- Set `LINK_SOURCE` to the **guard account** (username/id) so it only trusts the
  guard's messages. Leave blank to accept an invite link from any private chat.

```bash
python quickreply.py      # first run: logs in this account + asks LINK_SOURCE
```

On each new link it swaps the link inside the shortcut's messages in place
(`getQuickReplies` -> `getQuickReplyMessages` -> `editMessage` with
`quick_reply_shortcut_id`), preserving all other text and entities.

With `GREET_NEW=1` it also acts as a **first-contact auto-responder**: when
anyone DMs this account for the **first time**, it copies your current Business
**away message** and sends it to them (via `users.getFullUser` ->
`business_away_message.shortcut_id` -> `sendQuickReplyMessages`). Greeted user
ids are remembered in `data/greeted.json`, so nobody is greeted twice.

> Business quick replies require **Telegram Premium** on that account.

The setup, channel picker, and runtime output are **colorized** via `colorama`
(auto-falls back to plain text if it isn't installed).

## `.env`

| `CHANNEL`        | Channel to guard (@username / -100 id / link)       |
| `OWNER`          | Who receives the links (@username or user id)       |
| `ROTATE_MINUTES` | How often to revoke + reissue the link (default 5)  |
| `LINK_SOURCE`    | (quickreply) account that sends the link; blank = any |
| `SHORTCUT`       | (quickreply) quick reply name (default `demo`)      |
| `GREET_NEW`      | (quickreply) send away msg to first-time DMs (default 1) |

## Notes

- The owner is resolved by `get_entity` — a **@username** always works. A bare
  user id works only if the account already shares a chat with the userbot
  (e.g. the owner is in the channel).
- Admins can't be kicked (Telegram restriction); those attempts are ignored.
- `.env` and `*.session` are gitignored — never commit them.
